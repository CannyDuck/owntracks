No guarantees whatsoever as to availability, but our track record is pretty good so far.\n\n\nThe first thing you do in order to use \nHosted\n mode is to sign up at  \nOwnTracks Hosted\n where you create an account providing a \nusername\n, a \npassword\n, a valid \ne-mail address\n for yourself, and your \nname\n.

What we do is we hash them securely and store [PBKDF2] strings. When either you login to our Web site, or your device authenticates to our MQTT broker with the \naccess token\n, we take the values you connect with, hash them again, and test whether the PBKDF2 we have on record matches what we computed.

            "text": "MQTT\n\n\nSo what's this MQTT thing? Quoting directly \nfrom the horse's mouth\n:\n\n\n\n\nMQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/\"Internet of Things\" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers\n\n\n\n\nWe've tried, but we couldn't have phrased this better.\n\n\nIt's lightweight. It's easy on a battery. It has a low overhead (important to save on your phone's data plan). And it distributes information to one or more receivers.\n\n\nPub/Sub\n\n\nIn MQTT-speak, clients publish messages, which means they send or transmit them, and other clients subscribe to messages, meaning they receive them. Messages are published on \ntopics\n, and the MQTT server, which is called a \nbroker\n is configured to permit or deny clients doing so.\n\n\nCauldron\n\n\nWe like to imagine that MQTT makes something reminiscent of a large \ncauldron\n available to publishing and subscribing clients. Publishers drop messages which are tagged \nwith topic names\n into the pot, and subscribers can, access-control permitting, slurp these out, store them, create new messages and ladle them back into the pot or simply throw them away after peeking at them. As a small example, assume a client periodically publishes a Celsius temperature measurement to a particular topic, but you want Fahrenheit (incomprehensible that you would, but anyway). You could \ncreate a small client\n which subscribed to the Celsius reading (from the topic, say, \ntemp/celsius\n in the cauldron), converted to Fahrenheit or Kelvin or whatever, and republished the new value to a different topic, say, \ntemp/fahrenheit\n back into the cauldron. It's important to understand that subscribing and receiving an MQTT message does \nnot remove\n it from the broker; the same message is available to all clients which are subscribed at the time the message was published. (So you could have one client doing Fahrenheit conversion and another doing Kelvin.)\n\n\nAnd what does OwnTracks have to do with all of this? Well, the OwnTracks apps are MQTT clients which publish messages (your location) and subscribe to and consume messages (e.g. the locations of \nyour friends\n). OwnTracks' location updates land in the cauldron when the app publishes a location message from which it can be consumed by any number of subscribers to the same \nMQTT broker\n.\n\n\nThere are \na number of clients\n which do that already, and we're even going to show you how you can \ncreate your own client\n for specific purposes.",

Messages are published on  topics , and the MQTT server, which is called a  broker  is configured to permit or deny clients doing so.  Cauldron  We like to imagine that MQTT makes something reminiscent of a large  cauldron  available to publishing and subscribing clients. Publishers drop messages which are tagged  with topic names  into the pot, and subscribers can, access-control permitting, slurp these out, store them, create new messages and ladle them back into the pot or simply throw them away after peeking at them. As a small example, assume a client periodically publishes a Celsius temperature measurement to a particular topic, but you want Fahrenheit (incomprehensible that you would, but anyway). You could  create a small client  which subscribed to the Celsius reading (from the topic, say,  temp/celsius  in the cauldron), converted to Fahrenheit or Kelvin or whatever, and republished the new value to a different topic, say,  temp/fahrenheit  back into the cauldron. It's important to understand that subscribing and receiving an MQTT message does  not remove  it from the broker; the same message is available to all clients which are subscribed at the time the message was published. (So you could have one client doing Fahrenheit conversion and another doing Kelvin.)  And what does OwnTracks have to do with all of this? Well, the OwnTracks apps are MQTT clients which publish messages (your location) and subscribe to and consume messages (e.g. the locations of  your friends ). OwnTracks' location updates land in the cauldron when the app publishes a location message from which it can be consumed by any number of subscribers to the same  MQTT broker .  There are  a number of clients  which do that already, and we're even going to show you how you can  create your own client  for specific purposes.",

For example,\na topic for a device that publishes a temperature reading of your living room\nmay be \ntemperature/indoors/living\n, whereas a device which publishes weather\ndata could do so to \nweather/germany/frankfurt\n. In the particular case of OwnTracks, we\nuse a topic branch called \nowntracks/username/device\n, but you can override that\nname if you prefer to. The reason we've chosen that structure is to accomodate\nfriends and family on a single broker, taking into consideration that a particular\nuser might have more than one device.\n\n\nPrivate broker\n\n\nIdeally, you set up a private broker under your control. This sounds more difficult\nthan it actually is, and there are some very nice brokers you can use free of charge\non your own infrastructure. As an example, we've written up how to install\nMosquitto on a Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nRasPi\n\n\n\n\nThe hardest bit is installing an OS, say, \nRaspbian Wheezy\n, onto an SD card, but there are many tutorials on how to do that.

We first perform the required steps to add and activate the repository. The last step in particular can take a few moments.\n\n\ncurl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nsudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\nrm mosquitto-repo.gpg.key\ncd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/\nsudo curl -O http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.list\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n\nNow we can go ahead and install \nMosquitto\n proper.

This section is geared towards a configuration of \nMosquitto\n which will\nwork well with OwnTracks. In particular we want the following features enabled\nby default:\n\n\n\n\nConnections to the broker must be \nTLS\n protected. This requires a TLS certificate and key which will be configured automatically.\n\n\nACLs will restrict who may access what.\n\n\n\n\nOver at the \nOwnTracks repository\n, we've got some utilities which are going to automate this. It's a work-in-progress (of course), but this is what \nsudo ./mosquitto-setup.sh\n looks like at the moment:\n\n\nSaving previous configuration as mosquitto.conf-20130901-133525\nGenerating a 2048 bit RSA private key\n.................................................................................................+++\n...............................+++\nwriting new private key to '/etc/mosquitto/ca.key'\n-----\nCreated CA certificate in /etc/mosquitto/ca.crt\nsubject=\n    commonName                = An MQTT broker\n    organizationName          = MQTTitude.org\n    emailAddress              = nobody@example.net\n--- Creating server key and signing request\nGenerating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus\n............+++\n..............+++\ne is 65537 (0x10001)\n--- Creating and signing server certificate\nSignature ok\nsubject=/CN=raspberrypi/O=MQTTitude.org/emailAddress=nobody@example.net\nGetting CA Private Key\n\n\n\n\nA CA is created together with a server key-pair with a whole bunch of \nsubjAltName\n\nsettings:\n\n\n    X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:\n        IP Address:192.168.1.189, IP Address:127.0.0.1, IP Address:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, DNS:broker.example.com, DNS:foo.example.de, DNS:localhost\n\n\n\n\nWill it work? Let's start the broker manually to see what it says:\n\n\nsudo /usr/sbin/mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf\n1378042632: mosquitto version 1.2 (build date 2013-08-09 21:49:03+0100) starting\n1378042632: Config loaded from /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf.\n1378042632: Opening ipv4 listen socket on port 1883.\n1378042632: Opening ipv4 listen socket on port 8883.\n1378042632: Opening ipv6 listen socket on port 8883.\n1378042632: Warning: Address family not supported by protocol\n...^C\n1378042634: mosquitto version 1.2 terminating\n1378042634: Saving in-memory database to /tmp/mosquitto.db.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mosquitto clients need to have access to a copy of the CA certificate (\nca.crt\n) and you can transport that insecurely to your clients (it's a public certificate).\n\n\nmosquitto_pub  --cafile ca.crt -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8883  ...\n\n\n\n\nThat's it for the moment. \n\n\nTesting\n\n\nOnce you've chosen an MQTT broker, make sure you feel comfortable with the\nutilities it provides to subscribe and publish to topics. We recommend the\n\nMosquitto\n utilities for doing so.\n\n\nFor example, to subscribe to all topics prefixed by \nowntracks\n on your broker:\n\n\nmosquitto_sub -h hostname -p 1883 -v -t 'owntracks/#'\n\n\n\n\n(Note that the hash symbol has to be quoted in the shell which is why we've put\nthe whole topic branch in single quotes.)\n\n\nIn another screen you could publish a test message:\n\n\nmosquitto_pub -h hostname -p 1883 -t 'owntracks/test' -m 'hello world'\n\n\n\n\nand in the first screen you'd see the topic name followed by a space and the message\n\npayload\n.\n\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with what is going on, you should consider adding \nTLS\n.\n\n\nBridging\n\n\nIf you want to connect two (or more) brokers (e.g. yours and that of your friend) you can, and we've written up \nhow you can bridge brokers\n.\n\n\nLogging\n\n\nBefore doing anything else, please consult the manual to determine where your Mosquitto logs are being written to. It's hard stabbing around in the dark when a glance at a log file can give you valuable tips on what is actually happening.\n\n\nMosquitto typically logs via \nsyslog\n, and \nsyslog\n's configuration defines where the log messages are actually written to. Your \nsyslog\n may be called \nsyslog\n, \nrsyslog\n, \nsyslog-ng\n, or anything else for that matter. In case of doubt, check the files in \n/var/log\n; one of them \nought\n to have what you're looking for (e..g \nmessages\n, \nsyslog\n, \nlocalmessages\n, or even \ndebugmessages\n).\n\n\nMosquitto typically logs each connection request, a publish, a subscribe request, etc. (Read the \nmanpage for \nmosquitto.conf\n to learn how to configure logging.\n\n\nA successful publish of an OwnTracks location could look somewhat like this:\n\n\nmosquitto[1366]: Received PUBLISH from jane-5s-m-o (d0, q2, r1, m7, 'owntracks/jane/5s', ... (159 bytes))\nmosquitto[1366]: Sending PUBREC to jane-5s-m-o (Mid: 7)\nmosquitto[1366]: Received PUBREL from jane-5s-m-o (Mid: 7)\nmosquitto[1366]: Sending PUBCOMP to jane-5s-m-o (Mid: 7)\n\n\n\n\nACLs\n\n\nYou will definitely want to set up Access Control Lists (ACLs) on your broker so that you can control who may see what. As an example, suppose Jane (username \njjolie\n) should be able to publish to her \nOwnTracks MQTT topics\n and Fred (username \nfred\n) should be allowed to see Jane's location, we could configure something like this:\n\n\nuser jjolie\ntopic owntracks/jjolie/#\n\nuser fred\ntopic read owntracks/jjolie/5s\ntopic owntracks/fred/nexus/#\n\n\n\n\nFirewall\n\n\nIf you want to run your \nPrivate\n broker it's possibly going to be at home under your desk (or is it in your small office?). Be that as it may, how does an OwnTracks app reach (network-wise) that broker?  Chances are you have some form of router which connects the local network in your home to the Internet.\n\n\nOwnTracks runs on the device which is in your pocket or your purse, or wherever you placed it, and it must be able to connect to your MQTT broker, but it cannot: your router hopefully has a firewall configured on it which will allow outgoing (from your home outwards) connections, but it is sure to not allow incoming connections. We must change that, at least for MQTT, and we're going to assume you've configured TLS, i.e. your broker is (also) listening on TCP port 8883\n\n\nWhat you need to do to get this working is to reconfigure your router to allow incoming TCP traffic on port 8883 and to hand that off to the TCP/IP address of your MQTT broker. The exact details on how to do that vary from vendor to vendor, but a close look at the documentation of your router should show you how to do that.\n\n\nWhat is also likely, or at least possible, is that your home doesn't have a fixed TCP/IP address, but one which changes periodically. The OwnTracks apps won't be able to find your home then, will they? If you keep \"moving\" (i.e changing addresses).\n\n\nA service which is typically (if maybe incorrectly) called dynamic DNS comes to the rescue. These services allow you to configure a DNS name (e.g. \nfreds-router.example.org\n) which points to the changing IP address of your router.\n\n\nOnce you've completed those steps, configure the OwnTracks apps to use the shiny new DNS name and TCP port number (8883) and you should be all set.\n\n\nOwnTracks\n\n\nSo, you've configured your broker and you are familiar with the \nmosquitto\n command-line\nclients, so now it's time to see if you can \nget OwnTracks to speak to your broker\n.",

That's it for the moment.   Testing  Once you've chosen an MQTT broker, make sure you feel comfortable with the\nutilities it provides to subscribe and publish to topics. We recommend the Mosquitto  utilities for doing so.  For example, to subscribe to all topics prefixed by  owntracks  on your broker:  mosquitto_sub -h hostname -p 1883 -v -t 'owntracks/#'  (Note that the hash symbol has to be quoted in the shell which is why we've put\nthe whole topic branch in single quotes.)  In another screen you could publish a test message:  mosquitto_pub -h hostname -p 1883 -t 'owntracks/test' -m 'hello world'  and in the first screen you'd see the topic name followed by a space and the message payload .  Once you feel comfortable with what is going on, you should consider adding  TLS .

It's hard stabbing around in the dark when a glance at a log file can give you valuable tips on what is actually happening.  Mosquitto typically logs via  syslog , and  syslog 's configuration defines where the log messages are actually written to. Your  syslog  may be called  syslog ,  rsyslog ,  syslog-ng , or anything else for that matter. In case of doubt, check the files in  /var/log ; one of them  ought  to have what you're looking for (e..g  messages ,  syslog ,  localmessages , or even  debugmessages ).  Mosquitto typically logs each connection request, a publish, a subscribe request, etc. (Read the  manpage for  mosquitto.conf  to learn how to configure logging.  A successful publish of an OwnTracks location could look somewhat like this:  mosquitto[1366]: Received PUBLISH from jane-5s-m-o (d0, q2, r1, m7, 'owntracks/jane/5s', ...

Be that as it may, how does an OwnTracks app reach (network-wise) that broker?  Chances are you have some form of router which connects the local network in your home to the Internet.  OwnTracks runs on the device which is in your pocket or your purse, or wherever you placed it, and it must be able to connect to your MQTT broker, but it cannot: your router hopefully has a firewall configured on it which will allow outgoing (from your home outwards) connections, but it is sure to not allow incoming connections. We must change that, at least for MQTT, and we're going to assume you've configured TLS, i.e. your broker is (also) listening on TCP port 8883  What you need to do to get this working is to reconfigure your router to allow incoming TCP traffic on port 8883 and to hand that off to the TCP/IP address of your MQTT broker. The exact details on how to do that vary from vendor to vendor, but a close look at the documentation of your router should show you how to do that.  What is also likely, or at least possible, is that your home doesn't have a fixed TCP/IP address, but one which changes periodically. The OwnTracks apps won't be able to find your home then, will they? If you keep \"moving\" (i.e changing addresses).  A service which is typically (if maybe incorrectly) called dynamic DNS comes to the rescue. These services allow you to configure a DNS name (e.g.  freds-router.example.org ) which points to the changing IP address of your router.  Once you've completed those steps, configure the OwnTracks apps to use the shiny new DNS name and TCP port number (8883) and you should be all set.

(See below for the nitty gritty.)\n\n\nConfiguring TLS (\nTransport Layer Security\n) for OwnTracks involves doing three things:\n\n\n\n\nObtain a TLS certificate/key pair (see below on how to do this) if you don't yet have one\n\n\nConfigure TLS on the MQTT broker\n\n\nConfiguring the app to use TLS\n\n\n\n\nYou can share the cerficate if you want to (though not many people will want it ...)\nIt's so public, that it's perfectly OK to send yourself the file by, say, e-mail.\n\n\nConfigure TLS on the Mosquitto broker\n\n\nWe'll first show you how to set up TLS on your Mosquitto \nbroker\n.\nThe basic configuration for TLS in \nmosquitto.conf\n is:\n\n\nlistener 8883\ntls_version tlsv1\ncafile .............\ncertfile .............\nkeyfile .............\n\n\n\n\n(see also: \nmosquitto-tls\n.)\n\n\n\n\n8883\n is the standard MQTT port for TLS connections. Change it if you need to, but make sure your OwnTracks app is configured to use the same port.\n\n\ntls_version\n specifies TLSv1 which is currently a requirement for the OwnTracks apps, as their APIs support that TLS version.\n\n\ncafile\n is the path to the certificate authority file\n\n\ncertfile\n points to your server's certificate in PEM format\n\n\nkeyfile\n points to your server's secret key file (which you \nnever\n divulge!)\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the OwnTracks app to use TLS\n\n\nWe show you here how to set up your iOS or Android device with that kind of certificate.\n\n\nIn both cases we assume you've got an e-mail in your inbox with the file you've sent yourself. This file has a \n.crt\n extension, and in both Android and iOS you can simply launch configuration by clicking on the attachment.\n\n\nIn our example, the CA certificate is called \nMQTTitude-ca.crt\n.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nNote that by following these instructions on Android you'll be prompted to set a device PIN or pattern to protect the device. If you already have that, just carry on. If you absolutely don't want to do that, you should download the certificate into, say, the Downloads folder, and configure it manually in OwnTracks (see below).\n\n\nSo, here's your e-mail message with said attachment.\n\n\n\n\nNow click on the attached file, and you'll get the following dialog where you have to specify a name for the certificate (sigh: the certificate contains a name, but Android wants you to name it anyway). Give it any old name. We've chosen \nMQTTitude\n, of course. Then click OK.\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. You're done, and if you no longer require the certificate file just delete the e-mail, though we recommend you keep it around for a bit.\n\n\nNote that installing a certificate into Android will, since Kitkat (4.4) bring up a warning when you power up your device. This warning is harmless (even though we consider it quite annoying).\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\nSo, here's your e-mail containing the certificate file. Click on it to launch the profile installer. No worries: we're not going to break anything. We're just adding yet another certificate to iOS' certificate store, and you're going to say that you trust that certificate. You ought to trust it: you've just created it yourself!\n\n\n\n\nYou've clicked, and here's the trust store. You see the certificate has a name, but it's not trusted yet. Click on Install.\n\n\n\n\nRead the text if you must. Just kidding: honestly, it's ok. But do read the text, and then click \"Install\" on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nThere you go! That's it: the certificate was installed.\n\n\n\n\nYou're done, and if you no longer require the certificate file just delete the e-mail, though we recommend you keep it around for a bit.\n\n\nmanual configuration on Android\n\n\nFrom the, say, e-mail you got with the certificate, click \"save\" on the attached \n.crt\n file which is stored on your device's \nDownload\n folder.\n\n\nIn OwnTracks's settings, select \nTLS (Custom Certificate)\n\n\n\n\nNow comes the hard part: you have to enter the path to the certificate you downloaded. On my device this is \n/storage/emulated/0/Download/MQTTitude.crt\n. Your mileage, etc; \n\n\n\n\nWhen you click \nConnect\n, it will try and use your certificate. Good luck! ;-)\n\n\nThe nitty gritty\n\n\nThat CA certificate file we mentioned?

            "text": "Location data is obtained by your smartphone and published to the \nMQTT broker\n as follows:\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nThe way it currently works is by specifying an interval in which you want to receive updates (the one you configure in the settings). You only receive updates if this amount of time has passed and you moved more than 500m (when the app is in the background. The movement restriction is set to 50m or so when in the foreground).\n\n\nSay I set an interval of 10min and I don't move; will I get a PUBlish? No. \nIf you move more than 500 meters in 5 minutes you'll get a PUB after 10 minutes. You won't get a PUB after 5 minutes though.\n\n\nAdditional restrictions apply regarding the update intervall. When switching into the background or foreground, a new location request is setup with a different granularity and energy requirement. As a result, a new location is received immedeately by the app. \n\n\nThus, when the app goes into the background, a new location is received. Most likely, this will not result in a publish as the last publish was not longer ago than 10 minutes. Say the last update was exactly 9 minutes ago when the background mode is enabled. In this case no publish will be sent. However, the next location will probably only be received after the specified 10 minutes. At this point, the time of the last publish is longer than 10 minutes ago. So in this worst case, around 20 will pass before a location will be sent. \n\n\nIf you switch on the app after one minute in the background (11 minutes after the last publish), a new report will be sent immediately as soon as a new location is available. \n\n\niOS\n\n\nThe iOS app offers 3 modes of location publication:\n\n\n\n\nManual\n mode\n\n\nSignificant location change\n mode\n\n\nMove\n mode\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this, there's also \nRegion Monitoring\n (a.k.a. Geo Fence) and \niBeacon Monitoring\n and \niBeacon Ranging\n.\n\n\nMOVE mode\n\n\nIn MOVE mode, the app monitors location permanently and publishes a new\nlocation as soon as the device moves \nx\n meters or after \nt\n seconds, whatever\nhappens first. \nx\n and \nt\n can be adjusted by the user in the systems settings for\nOwnTracks. The defaults are 100m and 300 seconds (5 minutes). \n\n\nThe payoff is higher battery usage as high as in navigation or tracker app.\nSo it is recommend to use MOVE mode while charging or during moves only - hence the name.\n\n\nPlease note, MOVE mode is active when the app is active (a.k.a in foreground).\n\n\nSIGNIFICANT LOCATION CHANGE mode\n\n\niOS defines a SIGNIFICANT LOCATION CHANGE as travelling a distance of at least\n500 meters in 5 minutes.  This mode allows the app to run in background and\nminimize the power consumption.\n\n\nThis standard tracking mode reports significant location changes only (\n500m\nand at most once every 5 minutes).  This is defined by Apple and is optimal\nwith respect to battery usage.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nif you don't move, no new location is published - even if you don't move for hours\n\n\nif you move at least 500 meters, a new location will be published after 5 minutes\n\n\nif you move 10 kilometers in 5 minutes, only one location will be published\n\n\n\n\nMANUAL mode\n\n\nThe app doesn't monitor location changes in MANUAL mode while in background.\nThe user has to publish the current location explicitly via the UI.\n\n\nREGION monitoring\n\n\nThe app user may mark a previously manually published or manually created \nlocation as a monitored circular region by specifying a monitoring radius in meters.\nThe app will publish the location\nadditionally everytime the device leaves or enters one of the regions, and the\npublished data contains an indication of whether the device is entering or\nleaving the region.\n\n\nRegion monitoring is not related to one of the location publication modes and\nworks independently. It is switched on when a region is setup with description\nand radius. To switch region monitoring off, all regions have to be \nunmarked (by setting radius to 0).\n\n\nRegions are shown on the map display in transparent blue or red circles. Red\nindicates the device is is within the region.\n\n\niBeacon monitoring\n\n\nThe app user may mark a previously manually published or manually created location\nas a monitored beacon region by appending a beacon uuid to the region's name.\nThe app will publish the location\nadditionally everytime the device leaves or enters one of the beacon regions, and the\npublished data contains an indication of whether the device is entering or\nleaving the region.\n\n\nRegion monitoring is not related to one of the location publication modes and\nworks independently. It is switched on when a region's name has a valid uuid\nappended.\n\n\nIf the device is within a monitored beacon region, the the beacon indicator\nis shown in red, otherwise blue meaning device is not in any iBeacon region.\n\n\nThere are 2 kinds of locations:\na) an \nautomatic location\n created when iOS detects a change of location\nb) a \nmanual location\n created by the user\n\n\nA \nmanual location\n with a non-zero length remark (description) is a \nwaypoint\n.\n\n\nIf a \nwaypoint\n is \nshared\n, its attributes are published when created or changed.\n\n\nIf a \nwaypoint\n specifies a radius, a \ncircular region\n is monitored for \nenter/leave events\n.\n\n\nIf a \nwaypoint\n is not a \ncircular region\n and the \nwaypoint\n's description contains a valid \niBeacon\n specification, a \nbeacon region\n is monitored for \nenter/leave events\n.\n\n\nIf an \nenter/leave event\n occurs an event message is published with the \ntype\n attribute set to \nc\nor \nb\nfor (\ncircular region\nor \nbeacon region\n).

            "text": "Setup\n\n\nThe most important step to configure the OwnTracks Android app is to configure the broker connection. To do so, specify the hostname and port of your broker in the connection preferences. Additionally, specify a name of your device and the username and password that is used to authenticate yourself on the broker.\n\n\nIn the unlikely case that your broker does not require a username and password, you can enable the advanced connection preferences \nPreferences/Advanced\n. Afterwards an additional menu to select anonymous authentication appears in the connection preferences. Please note that even then, you have to set a device name and username before you can connect as these are also used to construct various other internal things. \n\n\nPer default a [[TLS]] secured communication channel with the broker is assumed. Thus you have to ensure that the broker certificate is properly imported on your device. If you do not want to use TLS, you can enable the advanced connection preferences after which you can disable it in the connection preferences. \nIn recent Android, a passcode is required once custom TLS certificates are imported. If you want to circumvent this, you can enable TLS with custom certificates and specify the absolute filesystem path to the broker certificate on your device. This will circumvent the Android TLS certificate management by using the certificate directly. \n\n\n\n\nReporting\n\n\n\n\nContacts\n\n\nA single checkbox here which determines whether or not you wish to have\nlocation details shown [[for friends|Friends]].\n\n\nNotifications\n\n\n\n\nOwnTracks can optionally show the last reported location in the ticker area,\nfrom which you can also forcefully publish your current location.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map\n\n\nThe app's main screen is the map, which displays your location on it as well as\na reverse geo-coded location if possible.\n\n\n\n\nYou can zoom in and out of the map, and see [[your friends|Friends]] with their photos.\n\n\n\n\nBeta\n\n\nTo receive beta versions and help us with testing new features of the app, you have to join our \nGoogle+ Community\n. Afterwards you can register as a  \nbeta tester\n. After a short time, you will receive the current beta version as a regular update via the Google Play Store. If, for some reason you cannot/do not want to our Google+ community, you can grab the APK by selecting the latest Android tag of our repository from \nhttps://github.com/owntracks/android/tags\n and installing the APK from the apps/android/apk/mqttitude.apk. \n\n\nKeepalive\n\n\nDue to limitations of the Java MQTT library the Android app cannot send native ping messages. As a workaround a one byte long normal message is published to \n$SYS/keepalive\n periodically to keep the connection alive. It is important to ensure that this topic is writable by all Android devices.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\n\nTo contribute to the development, fork the project and clone it to your workstation. Continue to import the project into Eclipse/ADT and opt to open all sub-projects. If this does not automatically import the Google Play Services project into your workspace, import it manually as an extra project. Afterwards, check if the play services are references as project in \nProject Properties \n Android\n. Once imported, create a feature branch, write your changes and commit them to your feature branch. These changes can be pushed to your fork from which you can submit a pull-request to get your changes included in the official code.",

When the main screen appeares it shows the title bar\n\n\n\nbut hides it after a few seconds to give more room for the map (examples show iPhone 3 1/2\", but looks similar on iPhone 4\" and iPad).\n\n\n\n\nThe first time you start the app, the system asks you to give OwnTracks access to your location. Please hit OK.\n\n\n\nNow you'll notice the connection indicator in \nred\n (iPhone top/right, iPad bottom/right). Let's head to settings by\nusing the \nSettings\n tab on the iPhone or by activating the popover menu (hit 'Friends' button on bottom/left) and then \nSettings\n tab on the iPad.\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nYou're now in the settings panel for OwnTracks, and there are some things\nyou have to change. (See [[general settings|Settings]] for additional information.)\n\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by the number of settings, there are only 4 things you need to change (marked with an asterisk '*').\n1. \nDeviceID\n is a short name you'll give your device. Good examples could be \niphone\n, \nmyphone\n, or \nxyzz90\n.\n2. \nHost\n is the host name or IP address of your MQTT broker. (The port defaults to 8883 because we default to using TLS.)\n3. \nUserID\n is your username on the broker. Even if your broker doesn't enforce authentication, you \nmust set a UserID\n.\n4. \nPassword\n is the password for \nUserID\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adjusting your settings, you can check the MQTT broker connection by hitting \nCheck\n and watch the status change or look at the detail status screen (information button right of connection status in the first row).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need to fill out all fields, however to check the effective values have a look by hitting the information button to the right of UserID, ClientID, Topic or Will Topic.\n\n\nQuality of Service (QoS) settings for Reporting, Subscription or Will are indicated next to the descriptive label and can be altered by selecting the corresponding value after opening the detail selection screen.\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the screen to find the current application version, license information, a link to this documentation and the possibility to export all settings.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have successfully connected to your MQTT broker, switch the the main screen again (use the OwnTracks tab on iPhone or tap on the map on iPad).\n\n\nFollow your broker\n\n\nAt this time you should check that the MQTT broker is actually receiving location messages. (See [[MQTT broker|MQTTbroker]] on how to do this.)\n\n\nMain Screen\n\n\nLet's look at the main screen for a moment:\n\n\n\n\nThe icons on the bottom/top (iPad/iPhone) row are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFirst Button is User Tracking Mode\n\n\nSecond Button is Monitoring Mode and Indicator\n\n\na \nPAUSE\n symbol indicates no automatic location monitoring \n\n\na \nPLAY\nsymbol indicates significant location monitoring\n\n\na \nFAST FORWARD\n indicates move mode monitoring\n(See [[Location]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird Button is Beacon Mode and Indicator\n\n\nRED = inside iBeacon region\n\n\nBLUE = not within an iBeacon region\n\n\nGRAY = iBeacon status not available\n\n\nflashing = continously updating iBeacon distances (a.k.a. ranging)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForth Button is Connection Switch and Indicator\n\n\nBLUE=IDLE, no connection established\n\n\nGREEN=CONNECTED, server connection established\n\n\nAMBER=ERROR OCCURED, WAITING FOR RECONNECT, app will automatically try to reconnect to the server\n\n\nRED=ERROR, no connection to the server possible or transient errror condition\n\n\nanimated size changes indicate outgoing messages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system network activity indicator (in top status bar) is now used to indicate actual\ntransmission of messages.\n\n\nTo switch Map Mode, Monitoring Mode, Beacon Ranging and Switch Connection, tap on the corresponding button and select one of the displayed options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTap on Map Mode Follow to see your position.\n\n\nFriends\n\n\nThe [[Friends]] feature shows self and all Friends published by the server,\ntheir picture or OwnTracks default icon, and their last location.  Tapping on\nthe entry switches back to map centered on friend's last location.\n\n\nThe first time you launch the app you'll also be asked whether it may access your\ncontacts data, which you should allow. (If you change your mind later, \nPrivacy\n in\n\nGeneral settings\n allows you to disable the feature.)\n\n\nTapping on the disclosure indicator (little right-arrow) lists all received locations of the friend.\nApp keeps track of a number (see Settings) of own locations and the last location and sharedpoint of others.s\n Tapping on an location entry centers the map on the selected location.\n\n\nIf the location was set manually, a disclosure indicator allows changing the remark of the location (e.g. parked my car here!, started my run here!). Manual locations can only be deleted manually.\n\n\nDeleting locations or all locations of a friend is done by left-swipe on the entry.\n\n\nQ. As regards the friends list: when is reverse geo-coding done?\n\n\nReverse geo-coding is done when displaying/editing location details by either\n\n tapping the info button of a location callout on the map or\n\n navigating via friends/locations/...\n\n\nNo geo-coding is done automatically in the background to limit mobile data usage.\n\n\nLocation indicators and friendly faces\n\n\nThe locations of yourself, your friends and of the waypoints you set are displayed as little yellow circles. The color of the circumfence indicates\n\n Orange: yourself\n\n Blue: one of your waypoints\n* Green: one of your friends\n\n\n\n\nThe inner area of the circle either shows a picture of yourself / your friend or the Tracker ID (tid) which is usually 2 digits and defaults to the last two characters of the publish topic.\n\n\nA red, yellow rimmed tachometer indicating the velocity (speed) at the reported location starts at at the 6 o'clock position and works clockwise. It uses a logarithmic scale to show slow speeds\nas good as high speeds. The 9 o'clock position indicates a speed of 30 km/h, the 12 o'clock posistion a speed of 100 km/h. 3 o'clock means 180 km/h.\n\n\nA small blue, yellow rimmed semicircle at the perimeter indicates the course over ground (direction of movement)  with the 12 o'clock position meaning North.\n\n\nIf your iOS addressbook has an entry for, say, Jane Jolie, and Jane has an image associated with her addressbook entry, OwnTracks will show Jane's image on the map and on the [[Friends]] list, as soon as a location update for Jane is seen by the app.\n\n\nIn order to associate an MQTT topic with our friend (Jane, in this case), edit your addressbook entry on iOS for Jane and do either of the following:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new relashionship (like 'Spouse') called \nOwnTracks\n (case insensitive), and add your friend's topic name to that (e.g. \nowntracks/jane/loc\n)\n\n\n\n\nThe addressbook API might need a while to be refreshed, but you may be able to speed that up by swiping the Friends list downward until the activity indicator appears, then let go).\n\n\nor...\n\n\nTap the Bookmark Button in the Navigation Bar on the Location screen. Select an entry from your Address Book.\nThe entry will be marked with a relationship to the current friend's topic name.\n\n\nBeginning with iPhone app version 5.1, there's now a switch in Expert Mode settings titled \nUpdate Address Book\". If this is _on\n, the app uses related names from the address book to identify topics and updates address book as described above. If the switch is \noff\n, the app maintains an internal reference to the address book record and doesn't modify the address book.\n\n\nRegion Monitoring and Waypoints\n\n\nFor all manually published locations, a description, a region radius and a share flag can be edited.\n\n\nSetting the description of a location helps you to remember places.\n\n\nIf a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published to the MQTT broker as a \nwaypoint\n once.\nWaypoints shared by other users are displayed on the map and are visible in the Friends/Locations... table.\n\n\nIf the description is non-empty and a radius \n 0 (meters) is set, the app starts monitoring the circular region around the coordinate. A region may be 'waypoint'.\nThe regions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the device is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish.\n\n\nIf the description is non-empty and includes a value UUID for an iBeacon, the app starts monitoring the iBeacon region. e.g. 'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nmonitors any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant.\n\n\nEverytime the devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message is published to the MQTT broker.\n\n\nUse cases:\n\n Define a \nhome\n region to insure that the device publishes a new location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than 500m.\n\n Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\").\n\n Keep a private note (\"Parked Car here\").\n\n Use iBeacons to accurately report enter/leave events for your home\n* Use iBeacons to publish enter/leave events for individual rooms/floors in your home\n\n\nWaypoints\n\n\nAll manually published locations can be edited (by tapping on the \n(I)\n to add\na description. If the \nShare\n flag is on, this waypoint is published to the\n[[MQTT broker|MQTTbroker]] along with its location information. Setting a\ndescription helps you remember particular points of interest.\n\n\nIf a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published\nto the MQTT broker as a waypoint once. Waypoints shared by other users are\ndisplayed on the map and are visible in the \nFriends/Locations\n table.\n\n\nRegion monitoring (a.k.a. Geo Fences)\n\n\nIf the waypoint description is non-empty and a radius \n 0 (meters) is set, the\napp starts monitoring the circular region around the specified coordinates. \nRegions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the\ndevice is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish. Every time\nthe devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message\nis published to the MQTT broker, specifying whether the device is entering or leaving\nsaid region.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, you can define a home region to ensure that the device publishes a\nnew location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than\n500m. Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\"). Keep\na private note (\"Parked Car here\").\n\n\nRegion Monitoring with iBeacons\n\n\nRather than setting the radius, you may add your iBeacon's UUID and optionally major and minor numbers\nto the description to start region monitoring using iBeacons.\n\n\ne.g.\n* 'myBeacon:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959:0001:CAFE'\nreports region with description 'myBeacon' when the iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., major = 0001 and minor = CAFE is in proximity\n\n\n\n\n'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nreports region with description 'myBeacons' when any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant is in proximity\n\n\n\n\nRemote configuration\n\n\nYou can help your friends customize their copy of OwnTracks with [[remote configuration|RemoteConfig]].\n\n\nWhy do location publishes sometimes seem to cease to work?\n\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n\nIf the app goes into Background, the connection is disconnected because the app\ncannot maintain the TCP connection in background.\n\n\nIf you bring the app back into foreground, the app will re-connect.\n\n\nWhen a location change is recorded (no matter if manual, significant, move or\nregion mode), a message is prepared and an attempt to connect to the broker is\nstarted. If there is an error, connect will be retried after 2, 4, 8, ..., 64,\n64, .... seconds until it succeeds.\n\n\nBUT...\n\n\nIf the application is in background or is sent to the background, retries are\nrestarted eventually - depending on IOS' background execution model about every 10 minutes.\n\n\nWith automatic modes switched off, even when bringing the app to foreground, no\nnew location updates are generated.",

Don't get overwhelmed by the number of settings, there are only 4 things you need to change (marked with an asterisk '*').\n1.  DeviceID  is a short name you'll give your device. Good examples could be  iphone ,  myphone , or  xyzz90 .\n2.  Host  is the host name or IP address of your MQTT broker. (The port defaults to 8883 because we default to using TLS.)\n3.  UserID  is your username on the broker. Even if your broker doesn't enforce authentication, you  must set a UserID .\n4.  Password  is the password for  UserID .      After adjusting your settings, you can check the MQTT broker connection by hitting  Check  and watch the status change or look at the detail status screen (information button right of connection status in the first row).     You do not need to fill out all fields, however to check the effective values have a look by hitting the information button to the right of UserID, ClientID, Topic or Will Topic.  Quality of Service (QoS) settings for Reporting, Subscription or Will are indicated next to the descriptive label and can be altered by selecting the corresponding value after opening the detail selection screen.   Scroll down to the bottom of the screen to find the current application version, license information, a link to this documentation and the possibility to export all settings.   If you have successfully connected to your MQTT broker, switch the the main screen again (use the OwnTracks tab on iPhone or tap on the map on iPad).  Follow your broker  At this time you should check that the MQTT broker is actually receiving location messages. (See [[MQTT broker|MQTTbroker]] on how to do this.)  Main Screen  Let's look at the main screen for a moment:   The icons on the bottom/top (iPad/iPhone) row are as follows:   First Button is User Tracking Mode  Second Button is Monitoring Mode and Indicator  a  PAUSE  symbol indicates no automatic location monitoring   a  PLAY symbol indicates significant location monitoring  a  FAST FORWARD  indicates move mode monitoring\n(See [[Location]])    Third Button is Beacon Mode and Indicator  RED = inside iBeacon region  BLUE = not within an iBeacon region  GRAY = iBeacon status not available  flashing = continously updating iBeacon distances (a.k.a. ranging)    Forth Button is Connection Switch and Indicator  BLUE=IDLE, no connection established  GREEN=CONNECTED, server connection established  AMBER=ERROR OCCURED, WAITING FOR RECONNECT, app will automatically try to reconnect to the server  RED=ERROR, no connection to the server possible or transient errror condition  animated size changes indicate outgoing messages     The system network activity indicator (in top status bar) is now used to indicate actual\ntransmission of messages.  To switch Map Mode, Monitoring Mode, Beacon Ranging and Switch Connection, tap on the corresponding button and select one of the displayed options:      Tap on Map Mode Follow to see your position.  Friends  The [[Friends]] feature shows self and all Friends published by the server,\ntheir picture or OwnTracks default icon, and their last location.  Tapping on\nthe entry switches back to map centered on friend's last location.  The first time you launch the app you'll also be asked whether it may access your\ncontacts data, which you should allow. (If you change your mind later,  Privacy  in General settings  allows you to disable the feature.)  Tapping on the disclosure indicator (little right-arrow) lists all received locations of the friend.\nApp keeps track of a number (see Settings) of own locations and the last location and sharedpoint of others.s\n Tapping on an location entry centers the map on the selected location.  If the location was set manually, a disclosure indicator allows changing the remark of the location (e.g. parked my car here!, started my run here!). Manual locations can only be deleted manually.  Deleting locations or all locations of a friend is done by left-swipe on the entry.  Q. As regards the friends list: when is reverse geo-coding done?  Reverse geo-coding is done when displaying/editing location details by either  tapping the info button of a location callout on the map or  navigating via friends/locations/...  No geo-coding is done automatically in the background to limit mobile data usage.  Location indicators and friendly faces  The locations of yourself, your friends and of the waypoints you set are displayed as little yellow circles. The color of the circumfence indicates  Orange: yourself  Blue: one of your waypoints\n* Green: one of your friends   The inner area of the circle either shows a picture of yourself / your friend or the Tracker ID (tid) which is usually 2 digits and defaults to the last two characters of the publish topic.  A red, yellow rimmed tachometer indicating the velocity (speed) at the reported location starts at at the 6 o'clock position and works clockwise. It uses a logarithmic scale to show slow speeds\nas good as high speeds. The 9 o'clock position indicates a speed of 30 km/h, the 12 o'clock posistion a speed of 100 km/h. 3 o'clock means 180 km/h.  A small blue, yellow rimmed semicircle at the perimeter indicates the course over ground (direction of movement)  with the 12 o'clock position meaning North.  If your iOS addressbook has an entry for, say, Jane Jolie, and Jane has an image associated with her addressbook entry, OwnTracks will show Jane's image on the map and on the [[Friends]] list, as soon as a location update for Jane is seen by the app.  In order to associate an MQTT topic with our friend (Jane, in this case), edit your addressbook entry on iOS for Jane and do either of the following:   Create a new relashionship (like 'Spouse') called  OwnTracks  (case insensitive), and add your friend's topic name to that (e.g.  owntracks/jane/loc )   The addressbook API might need a while to be refreshed, but you may be able to speed that up by swiping the Friends list downward until the activity indicator appears, then let go).  or...  Tap the Bookmark Button in the Navigation Bar on the Location screen. Select an entry from your Address Book.\nThe entry will be marked with a relationship to the current friend's topic name.  Beginning with iPhone app version 5.1, there's now a switch in Expert Mode settings titled  Update Address Book\". If this is _on , the app uses related names from the address book to identify topics and updates address book as described above. If the switch is  off , the app maintains an internal reference to the address book record and doesn't modify the address book.  Region Monitoring and Waypoints  For all manually published locations, a description, a region radius and a share flag can be edited.  Setting the description of a location helps you to remember places.  If a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published to the MQTT broker as a  waypoint  once.\nWaypoints shared by other users are displayed on the map and are visible in the Friends/Locations... table.  If the description is non-empty and a radius   0 (meters) is set, the app starts monitoring the circular region around the coordinate. A region may be 'waypoint'.\nThe regions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the device is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish.  If the description is non-empty and includes a value UUID for an iBeacon, the app starts monitoring the iBeacon region. e.g. 'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nmonitors any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant.  Everytime the devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message is published to the MQTT broker.  Use cases:  Define a  home  region to insure that the device publishes a new location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than 500m.  Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\").  Keep a private note (\"Parked Car here\").  Use iBeacons to accurately report enter/leave events for your home\n* Use iBeacons to publish enter/leave events for individual rooms/floors in your home  Waypoints  All manually published locations can be edited (by tapping on the  (I)  to add\na description. If the  Share  flag is on, this waypoint is published to the\n[[MQTT broker|MQTTbroker]] along with its location information. Setting a\ndescription helps you remember particular points of interest.  If a description is entered and the share flag set, the location is published\nto the MQTT broker as a waypoint once. Waypoints shared by other users are\ndisplayed on the map and are visible in the  Friends/Locations  table.  Region monitoring (a.k.a. Geo Fences)  If the waypoint description is non-empty and a radius   0 (meters) is set, the\napp starts monitoring the circular region around the specified coordinates. \nRegions are shown on the map as blue-ish circles. If the\ndevice is within a region, the corresponding circle turns red-ish. Every time\nthe devices enters or leaves a monitored region, an additional location message\nis published to the MQTT broker, specifying whether the device is entering or leaving\nsaid region.   For example, you can define a home region to ensure that the device publishes a\nnew location when coming home or leaving home even if you do not move more than\n500m. Share your favorite places with your friends (\"Best Sushi in Town\"). Keep\na private note (\"Parked Car here\").  Region Monitoring with iBeacons  Rather than setting the radius, you may add your iBeacon's UUID and optionally major and minor numbers\nto the description to start region monitoring using iBeacons.  e.g.\n* 'myBeacon:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959:0001:CAFE'\nreports region with description 'myBeacon' when the iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., major = 0001 and minor = CAFE is in proximity   'myBeacons:CA271EAE-5FA8-4E80-8F08-2A302A95A959'\nreports region with description 'myBeacons' when any iBeacon identified with UUID = CA..., with major and minor numbers irrelevant is in proximity   Remote configuration  You can help your friends customize their copy of OwnTracks with [[remote configuration|RemoteConfig]].  Why do location publishes sometimes seem to cease to work?  Here's what happens:  If the app goes into Background, the connection is disconnected because the app\ncannot maintain the TCP connection in background.  If you bring the app back into foreground, the app will re-connect.  When a location change is recorded (no matter if manual, significant, move or\nregion mode), a message is prepared and an attempt to connect to the broker is\nstarted. If there is an error, connect will be retried after 2, 4, 8, ..., 64,\n64, .... seconds until it succeeds.  BUT...  If the application is in background or is sent to the background, retries are\nrestarted eventually - depending on IOS' background execution model about every 10 minutes.  With automatic modes switched off, even when bringing the app to foreground, no\nnew location updates are generated.",

You may have to install \nsetuptools\n via your distribution's package manager.\n\n\nInstall the \nPaho Python\n module using\n\n\npip install paho-mqtt\n\n\n\n\nProgress reports\n\n\nAssume we want to create a program which should report the location of our friends, as a simple list:\n\n\nTID = n4 is currently at 51.0343863, 9.4763712\nTID = n7 is currently at 52.7343671, 7.8764431\nTID = jp is currently at 53.134404655, 8.1063173\n\n\n\n\nWe need a small utility program which will subscribe to location publishes received by your broker by connecting to it on \nlocalhost\n and subscribing to \nowntracks/+/+\n (a wild-card expression in which each \n+\n means \nanything at this level\n).\n\n\nThe Code\n\n\nFor each received message, the utility attempts to decode the JSON payload and then prints the tracker-ID (\nTID\n) as well as latitude, longitude coordinates. Keep a copy of our \nOwnTracks-JSON\n documentation handy and study the topic names of each possible publish by the apps.\n\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport paho.mqtt.client as mqtt\nimport json\n\n# The callback for when the client successfully connects to the broker\ndef on_connect(client, userdata, rc):\n    ''' We subscribe on_connect() so that if we lose the connection\n        and reconnect, subscriptions will be renewed.
