# OwnTracks

OwnTracks allows you to keep track of your own location. You can build your private location diary or share it with your family and friends. OwnTracks is open-source and uses open protocols for communication so you can be sure your data stays secure and private.

To get started, install OwnTracks on your smartphone. Afterwards you can connect it to an existing server straight away or follow the guide in our [Dokumentation](http://owntracks.org/booklet/) to set up your own.
